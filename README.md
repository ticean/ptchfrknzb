Ptchfrknzb
===========================

Ptchfrknzb is a Chrome Extension that scrapes websites for search terms and searches NzbMatrix for results.
It presents search results within the webpage, and lets the user take action.

It's like CouchPotato's Automatic Movie Downloader, but it leaves out the vowels.


### NzbMatrix and Downloads ###
NzbMatrix bookmarks are the supported method of taking action. It's super simple to set up an RSS watch from sabnzbd.
Plugins can provide category id's so the bookmark feeds can be sorted.


### Supported Sites ###
Ptchfrknzb currently supports searching while browsing album reviews on Pitchfork.com.

But is designed to be extensible. Plugins can be written for any site. IMDB and others are on the short list.


### Writing Plugins ###
Plugins are fairly simple to write. Simply implement 2 methods:

 - scrape() provides site-specific scraping for search terms.
 - place() renders search results out to screen.

Plugins can also set some basic NzbMatrix settings.
